This will only fire if the current application version is greater than the local database version . 

It runs before any queries.

from: from is the current version of the local database .     
to: to is the version number of the program currently running, which is schemaVersion .

## beforeOpen
Run before opening the database. 
It runs after migrations, but before any other query .


### Migration Full Code
```dart
// implement migration  
MigrationStrategy get migration {  
  return MigrationStrategy(  
      // onCreate is called only if no database has been created locally
 
      onCreate: (Migrator m) async {  
    print("onCreate");  
    await m.createAll();  
  },  
  
  
      // This will only fire if the current application version is greater than the local database version
      // It runs before any queries
      // from: from is the current version of the local database   
      // to: to is the version number of the program currently running, which is schemaVersion    
      
	onUpgrade: (Migrator m, int from, int to) async {  
    print("onUpgrade from is $from to is $to");  
  },  
  
  
      // Run before opening the database 
      // It runs after migrations, but before any other query  
       
       beforeOpen: (OpeningDetails details) async {  
    print("beforeOpen details versionNow ${details.versionNow}");  
    // The schema version after running migrations.  
	// onUpgrade to
    print("beforeOpen details versionBefore ${details.versionBefore}");  
    // When onCreate is triggered, it is set to true  
    print("beforeOpen details wasCreated ${details.wasCreated}");  
    // When onUpgrade is triggered, it is set to true  
    print("beforeOpen details hadUpgrade ${details.hadUpgrade}");  
  });  
}
```

Changing column constraints

  todoItems.content: const Constant("columnTransformer"),  
}));
```
